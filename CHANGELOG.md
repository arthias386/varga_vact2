# CHANGELOG.md

## Purpose
The `CHANGELOG.md` file is used to document all notable changes made to the project. This includes new features, bug fixes, and other significant updates. It helps keep track of the project's history and provides transparency to users and contributors about what has changed between versions.

## Format
The changelog should follow a consistent format, typically organized by version number and date. Each entry should include a brief description of the change, categorized by type (e.g., Added, Changed, Fixed, Removed).
